            <p>Coffee shops often have a unique ambiance that combines a sense of calm with just the right amount of background noise.
                This can create a “productive buzz” that many people find helps them focus.</p>
    
            <p>Having coffee and snacks readily available can keep you energized without having to leave the workspace.
                Many coffee shops also offer a range of beverages and food to suit different tastes and dietary needs.</p>
    
            <p>So that is why i love to working and hangout at Coffee shop.
                Even when im hangout with my friends, because lot of my friends is coffee lover</p>
